  <h2>CSP strict-dynamic bypass by @kkotowicz</h2>
  <h3>via Polymer itself.</h3>
  <p>Improvement over <a href="poc2.vulcanized.html">poc2.html</a>. No component is needed, as Polymer itself will just document.createElement('script').

  No idea how applicable that one is in real Polymer apps, might be bogus.
